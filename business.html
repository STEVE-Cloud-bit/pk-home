            <h2>🌱 A Balanced Approach: Physical & Mental Activities in Avocado Farming (Section 3)</h2>
            <p>Avocado farming is more than just growing trees—it’s a <strong>combination of physical labor and strategic thinking</strong> that drives efficiency, sustainability, and profitability. Both <strong>farm and office activities</strong> play a crucial role in ensuring a smooth operation, from soil preparation to market strategy.</p>

            <h3>💪 Physical Activities: The Backbone of Avocado Farming</h3>

            <h4>🌿 Inside the Farm</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Soil Preparation & Planting</strong> – Ensuring fertile soil and optimal seedling placement for strong tree growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Irrigation & Pest Control</strong> – Managing water distribution and protecting crops from diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Pruning & Harvesting</strong> – Enhancing productivity by maintaining healthy trees and collecting high-quality fruit.</li>
                <li><strong>Sorting & Packing</strong> – Ensuring avocados meet market standards before distribution.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>🏢 Inside the Office</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Warehouse Handling</strong> – Organizing inventory, packaging, and shipping orders efficiently.</li>
                <li><strong>Customer & Supplier Engagement</strong> – Managing transactions, coordinating deliveries, and handling inquiries.</li>

    <h1>🌱 Stronger Together: The Role of Neighbors in Avocado Farming 🌍 (Section 4)</h1>
    
    <p>Avocado farming does not exist in isolation—our neighbors, whether fellow farmers, businesses, or local communities, play a crucial role in shaping our success. A well-connected farming environment can boost productivity, ensure sustainability, and create economic opportunities. However, challenges may arise, and proactive collaboration is the key to overcoming them.</p>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>🌟 The Positives: How Neighbors Strengthen Avocado Farming</h2>
        
        <h3>✅ Sustainable Growth Through Cooperation</h3>
        <p>Neighbors can work together to share best farming practices, optimize resources, and prevent soil degradation. Through joint initiatives, farms can improve efficiency while protecting the environment.</p>
        
        <h3>✅ Water Management & Resource Sharing</h3>
        <p>Water is a valuable resource, and coordinated irrigation systems can help prevent shortages. By establishing fair water-sharing agreements, farmers ensure consistent crop hydration without overuse.</p>

        <h3>✅ Pest & Disease Control Strategies</h3>
        <p>A single outbreak can threaten entire farms, but when neighbors work together on integrated pest management, the risk is minimized. Early detection, preventive measures, and organic solutions protect avocado trees while maintaining ecological balance.</p>

        <h3>✅ Market & Business Collaboration</h3>
        <p>Rather than competing, neighbors can unite to access larger markets, form cooperatives, and reduce transportation costs. Shared storage facilities and processing plants help maintain quality and increase profitability.</p>

        <h3>✅ Community & Social Benefits</h3>
        <p>A strong neighborhood builds trust, security, and support. Farmers can exchange knowledge, hire local labor, and contribute to community development, creating a thriving and cooperative agricultural environment.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>⚠️ The Challenges: Addressing Neighbor-Related Issues</h2>
