            <h2>🌱 A Balanced Approach: Physical & Mental Activities in Avocado Farming (Section 3)</h2>
            <p>Avocado farming is more than just growing trees—it’s a <strong>combination of physical labor and strategic thinking</strong> that drives efficiency, sustainability, and profitability. Both <strong>farm and office activities</strong> play a crucial role in ensuring a smooth operation, from soil preparation to market strategy.</p>

            <h3>💪 Physical Activities: The Backbone of Avocado Farming</h3>

            <h4>🌿 Inside the Farm</h4>
